The cost of each black gift is X units.
The cost of every white gift is Y units.
The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is Z units.
Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.

Input Format

The first line will contain an integer T which will be the number of test cases.
There will be T pairs of lines. The first line of each test case will contain the values of integers B and W. Another line of each test case will contain the values of integers X, Y, and Z.

Constraints 
1<=T<=10 
0<=X,Y,Z,B,W<=10^9
Output Format
